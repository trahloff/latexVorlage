\section{Objective and Problem Statement}

The purpose of this research is to develop a framework for architects that enables them to decide if a "serverless" architectural approach is fitted for their stream-processing use-case.
One major objective is to asses the current industry understanding of "serverless" and evaluate the viability and range of application of this architecture pattern.
Moreover, it is supposed to assist the process of highlevel system design by providing a reference and guidance by introducing fPaaS\footnotemark capabilities and caveates.
