\section{Problem Definition}

Stream-processing has become one of the major computing problems enterprise system architects face today. Due to recent trends such as IoT, the amount of data that has to be categorized, analyzed and processed skyrocketed. 
Many companies such as Netflix\footnotemark or Uber\footnotemark adopted stream-processing patterns in combination with serverless computing to take on challenges that demand highly scale able and performant systems. 
This approach is particularly favourable for companies that operate inside the IoT domain such as Toyota\footnotemark or Quest\footnotemark.
